# Run all services locally 

1. go to the base directory of the project
2. run `docker-compose up`

## When and Why
- The project root has a compose file which contains all the applications needed to run the full project for local integration testing

## Good to know
- Use the `compose.yaml` file to tweak the configuration such as ports of env files used
